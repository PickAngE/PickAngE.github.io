            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Question: Here you can explain what or who the bot was based on. What was the inspiration behind creating Kernel?</p>
            <p>Answer: I always wanted to create a useful Discord bot. I had already made four other projects before the Kernel bot: 'CosMoS', the first one, in late 2021; 'Kanti' in mid-2025; 'Vidus' two months after Kanti; and 'Aura', an AI bot. The Kernel bot's code is mostly based on Kanti's, with a few elements from Vidus.</p>

            <h2>The Name 'Kernel'</h2>
            <p>Question: Here you can explain the story behind the name 'Kernel'. Why did you choose this name? What does it signify?</p>
            <p>Answer: Why Kernel? The idea came to me when I had some driver problems on my computer. I found out a corrupted kernel driver was the cause, and that's why I wanted to name my Discord bot that.</p>
