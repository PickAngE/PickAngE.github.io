            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <p><span class="q-label">Question:</span> What was the inspiration behind creating Kernel? How did this project come to life?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><span class="a-label">Answer:</span> I always wanted to create a useful Discord bot that could make server management easier. I had already made four other projects before the Kernel bot: 'C0sm0s', the first one, in late 2021; 'Kanti' in mid 2025; 'Vidus' two months after Kanti; and 'Aura', an AI bot. The Kernel bot's code is mostly based on Kanti's foundation, with enhanced features and elements from Vidus. Each iteration taught me something new about bot development and server management.</p>

        <section id="naming">
            <h2>The Name 'Kernel'</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <p><span class="q-label">Question:</span> Why did you choose the name 'Kernel'? What does it signify for the bot's purpose?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><span class="a-label">Answer:</span> The name has a personal story behind it. I was experiencing some driver problems on my computer, and after troubleshooting, I discovered that a corrupted kernel driver was the root cause of my issues. The kernel is the core of an operating system, managing everything behind the scenes. I found this concept perfect for a Discord bot - something that works in the background to keep your server running smoothly, just like a system kernel does for your computer.</p>

        <section id="why-kernel">
            <h2>Why Kernel?</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <p><span class="q-label">Question:</span> Why should anyone choose Kernel over other Discord bots? What makes it special, and why is the bot private?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><span class="a-label">Answer:</span> Kernel's main advantage is its exceptionally high level of customization and personalized approach. Unlike public bots that need to cater to millions of servers with generic features, Kernel is built from the ground up to meet the unique needs of specific servers. The bot is private to ensure a truly unique and tailored experience. By keeping it private, we can implement special commands and features that aren't available on public bots, optimize performance for specific use cases, and provide dedicated support. This exclusivity allows us to create something that feels truly custom-made rather than one-size-fits-all.</p>

        <section id="kernel-access">
            <h2>Kernel Private Access</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <p><span class="q-label">Question:</span> Can I use Kernel on my server? How does the selection process work?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><span class="a-label">Answer:</span> Currently, Kernel is completely private and access is highly restricted. The code and its usage are limited to pre-selected servers only. This isn't to be exclusive for the sake of it, but rather to maintain the quality of service and ensure that each implementation can be properly customized and supported. The selection process considers factors like server size, specific needs, and how well Kernel's features would integrate with the server's goals. While we can't offer public access at this time, we appreciate the interest and may consider expanding in the future.</p>

        <section id="privacy">
            <h2>Privacy & Security</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <p><span class="q-label">Question:</span> How can we trust you with our server data? What measures do you take to ensure privacy and security?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><span class="a-label">Answer:</span> We completely understand your concern - trust is earned, not given. Our primary commitment is to provide a service that prioritizes both security and privacy above all else. All data is handled with the highest level of confidentiality, and we follow strict data protection practices. We only collect the minimum data necessary for the bot to function effectively, never store sensitive information unnecessarily, and implement robust security measures to protect any data we do handle. We believe in full transparency about our practices and are always open to discussing our security measures with server admin who are considering Kernel for their communities.</p>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <p><span class="q-label">Question:</span> What technologies and frameworks does Kernel use? How is it maintained?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><span class="a-label">Answer:</span> Kernel is built using modern technologies to ensure reliability and performance. The bot leverages Discord.js for seamless Discord API integration, with a robust backend architecture designed for scalability. We maintain regular updates to keep up with Discord's API changes and continuously improve features based on user feedback from our selected servers. The codebase is actively maintained with regular security updates, performance optimizations, and feature enhancements. Our development follows best practices including version control, testing, and staged deployments to ensure stability.</p>

            <h2>Future Development</h2>
            <div class="question">
                <p><span class="q-label">Question:</span> What features are planned for future updates? How do you decide what to develop next?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><span class="a-label">Answer:</span> Our development roadmap is primarily driven by the needs of our current server partners and emerging Discord platform features. We're constantly working on enhancing existing features and exploring new possibilities like advanced analytics, improved automation tools, and better integration capabilities. Since we work closely with a limited number of servers, we can get direct feedback and implement requested features much more quickly than larger public bots. Every update is carefully planned and tested to ensure it adds real value without compromising the bot's performance or reliability.</p>
